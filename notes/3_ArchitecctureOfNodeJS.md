* Node.js Architecture
Node.js follows an event-driven, non-blocking, asynchronous architecture. It is built on Googleâ€™s V8 JavaScript Engine and uses the libuv library for handling asynchronous I/O operations.
 * Key Components:
1.	V8 JavaScript Engine
o	Compiles and executes JavaScript into machine code.
o	Provides high performance.
2.	Single-Threaded Event Loop
o	Core of Node.js.
o	Continuously monitors the Event Queue.
o	Enables handling of concurrent requests efficiently without creating multiple OS threads.
3.	Event Queue
o	Stores incoming client requests/events.
o	Managed by the Event Loop.
4.	Libuv and Thread Pool
o	Handles asynchronous operations like file system, DNS, and network.
o	Heavy tasks are offloaded to a background thread pool.
5.	Bindings and APIs
o	Node.js provides built-in APIs (written in C/C++) to communicate with the operating system.

ðŸ“Œ Working Process:
1.	Client request enters Event Queue.
2.	Event Loop processes requests:
o	Non-blocking requests executed immediately.
o	Blocking requests sent to thread pool.
3.	Completed tasks return results to Event Loop.
4.	Event Loop sends response to client.

âœ… Advantages of this Architecture:
â€¢	Highly scalable (can handle many requests concurrently).
â€¢	Efficient for I/O heavy applications (APIs, microservices, chat apps, streaming).
â€¢	Less memory and resource usage compared to multi-threaded servers.

ðŸ‘‰ In placements, if they ask:
â€¢	Why Node.js? â†’ Because of its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, it is ideal for scalable, real-time applications.
â€¢	Is Node.js single-threaded or multi-threaded? â†’ Node.js is single-threaded at the JavaScript layer but uses a thread pool internally (via libuv) for heavy operations.
